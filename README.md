# Libft
**My very first library in C, made for 42 School.**

This repository contains a collection of functions that replicate some of the standard C library functions as well as introduce additional utility functions. The library is primarily intended for use within the 42 School curriculum.

## Introduction
The **Libft** library provides a range of functions to perform various operations on strings, files, and linked lists. It serves as a foundational toolset for C programming, aiding in tasks such as memory manipulation, string processing, and data structure management. Some functions are optimized for performance, while others provide essential utilities.

## Usage
To use the **Libft** library, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
3. Run `make` to compile the library.

A compiled library named `libft.a` will be generated. You can link this library with your C programs to access the provided functions.
